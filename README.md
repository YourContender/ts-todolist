##### Easy to use, intuitive and at the same time very beautiful _todo-list_. The project is made using _json.server_, download the repository yourself and write in the console:

```
npm start
```

##### After that, start the project by typing in the console:

```
npm run dev
```

**To get to know the project better, I suggest testing its functionality, namely:**

**_adding new tasks_**
**_editing tasks_**
**_deleting tasks_**
**_mark of the completed task_**
**_task filtering_**
**_percentage calculation of completed tasks_**
**_change the background color_**
**_detailed information on each task_**

##### For mobile devices, adaptive is implemented
